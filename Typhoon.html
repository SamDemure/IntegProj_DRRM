        <p class="meaning">Typhoons, also known as hurricanes or cyclones in different regions, are powerful tropical
            storms characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and potentially devastating impacts.
            These storms form over warm ocean waters, gaining strength as they move across the water and can cause
            widespread damage when they make landfall.</p>

    <div class="red-rectangle">
        <p class="redrectangle-text">Typhoons form in tropical regions when warm ocean waters fuel the development of
            low-pressure systems, generating powerful winds that spiral around a calm center, known as the eye.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gray-rectangle">
        <p class="grayrectangle-text">These storms bring heavy rainfall, leading to flooding, landslides, and storm surges
            that can inundate coastal areas. The strong winds can cause structural damage, uproot trees, and disrupt
            power and communication lines.</p>
