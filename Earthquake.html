        An <span class="red-word">earthquake</span> is when the ground shakes because of the movement of rocks deep underground. It can be like the
        Earth's way of stretching or wiggling, and it can sometimes cause things to shake and move on the surface, like
        buildings and trees.

        Earthquakes may be classified as either tectonic or volcanic.
        In some cases, earthquakes may also be caused by human activities,
        such as detonation of explosives and deep mining. However,
        this type is mostly mild and may be felt only in tremors.
